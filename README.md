# green-computing-react
A simple single-page React app about green computing

### How the project is structured
- There are two main "views" - one for the first-time user and one for the typical user. Each view has different design patterns/features associated with it. This is meant to simulate how an interface should change as the user becomes more comfortable with it.

### About the project
- A React adaptation of my course project for 95-881 Web Application Development
- Responsive layout with custom CSS code
- Implemented common UX patterns such as popovers, wizards, input hints, and coach marks
- "eBooks" pages have content about green computing, as well as a calculator for users to calculate the number of trees saved when using eBooks
- This project makes use of both Class and Functional React components

### Other notes
- Only "eBooks" pages are accessible, other links and sitemap items are used for design purposes only
